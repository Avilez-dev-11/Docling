# Docling Community Exchange

Join us for an in person, interactive evening with refreshments, where you’ll have the opportunity to connect directly with the creators of Docling through collaborative Q & A —or just listen in and learn. Whether you're just getting started or already exploring advanced use cases, this is a chance to ask questions, share ideas, and deepen your understanding of structured document extraction at scale.
