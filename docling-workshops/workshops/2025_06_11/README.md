Topics:

- Install Docling and convert documents
- Navigate the output DoclingDocument (tables, pictures, etc)
- Enrich document components


### Lab 2: Enhanced Chunking and Vectorization with Docling

Code in [./LabCode/Docling_Lab2_code.ipynb](./LabCode/Docling_Lab2_code.ipynb).

Topics:

- Chunk a document by page
- Use the HierarchicalChunker
- Use the HybridChunker
- Compare the chunker techniques by reviewing the chunks statistics


### Lab 3: Building an AI-powered multimodal RAG system with Docling

Code in [./LabCode/Docling_Lab3_code.ipynb](./LabCode/Docling_Lab3_code.ipynb).

Topics:

- Build a RAG pipeline with with Docling and Langchain
- Enhance and customize the content serialization
